<h1>Wine-Ingredients-Analysis</h1>

<p> The Wine Ingredients Analysis project employs Plotly, Dash, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to explore the relationships between various ingredients used in the creation of three distinct types of wine (class_0, class_1, class_2). By visualizing these relationships, the application offers valuable insights into the composition of each wine class. The dataset, drawn from the sklearn library, forms the basis of this analysis. Through interactive charts and graphs, users can dynamically explore and comprehend the underlying patterns in wine production. This project serves as an excellent tool for wine enthusiasts, researchers, and professionals seeking a deeper understanding of the impact of ingredients on the final product.</p>

<p>The dataset utilized in this project is sourced from the sklearn library. It provides comprehensive attributes of different wine samples, forming the foundation for the analysis.</p>
